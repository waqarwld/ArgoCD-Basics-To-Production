# Argo CD: Basics to Production Course

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Argo CD – Basics to Production** course!

This repository is your central hub for learning **GitOps with Argo CD**, from core concepts to production-ready patterns.
It complements the video lectures with structured notes, diagrams, and configuration examples that help you understand **how Git becomes the source of truth and how Argo CD enforces it on Kubernetes**.

This course focuses on **GitOps principles first**, and then shows how Argo CD implements those principles in real-world Kubernetes environments.
